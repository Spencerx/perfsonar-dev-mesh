## Use 'mesh' blocks to to specify each mesh that the agent should configure
## a display for
<mesh>
    # Use 'configuration_url' to specify the URL where the agent should obtain
    # the mesh configuration from
    configuration_url             https://perfsonar-testbed-ma.grnoc.iu.edu/mesh_config/testbed.json

# Use the maddash_yaml to specify the location of the files to write. In a
# normal configuration, these should be left as what's included below.
maddash_yaml                 /etc/maddash/maddash-server/maddash.yaml

# The 'restart_services' option can be used to specify whether the services
# should be restarted after their configuration is updated. If the
# 'use_toolkit' variable below is set to 0, you will need to use the
# 'cron-restart_gui_services' cron script included in
# /opt/perfsonar_ps/mesh_config/doc to restart the services.
restart_services             0

# The 'use_toolkit' option can be used to specify whether the agent should use
# the pS-Performance Toolkit's configuration daemon to save the configuration,
# and restart the services. If the agent is not installed on a toolkit
# instance, you will make sure that the configuration files listed above are
# all writable by user 'perfsonar'. The 'perfsonar' user cannot restart the
# services so you will need to disable 'restart_services' above, and use the
# 'cron-restart_gui_services' cron script included in
# /opt/perfsonar_ps/mesh_config/doc to restart the services.
use_toolkit                  0

## The 'send_error_emails' option can be used to tell the agent to send an email
## (via sendmail) when an error occurs. These emails will be sent to the
## applicable administrators (e.g. the local administrator(s), the mesh
## administrator(s), the site administrator(s), and/or the host
## administrator(s).
send_error_emails             0

## The 'send_error_emails_to_mesh' option can be used to tell the agent to send
## an email to the mesh configuration administrators. If this is left unset,
## the only emails that will be sent out are to those listed in this
## configuration file.
send_error_emails_to_mesh     0

## By default, the from address for the error emails will be
## mesh_agent@[hostname]. However, if you'd like to specify a different email
## address, you can do so here.
#email_from_address           admin@host.site.edu

## One or more 'admin_email' options can be included to specify email addresses
## to send errors to. These email addresses will receive all errors (including
## parsing errors). This is in addition to the emails that will be sent to the
## various affected administrators (e.g. the mesh administrator or the site
## administrator).
#admin_email         admin1@site.edu
#admin_email         admin2@site.edu


# The default maddash test configurations. If the values aren't specified in
